# GitHub Bookmarks

This repo is a place for me to save and organize links to things on GitHub without having to star or fork everything (which isn't even possible with all "things" on GitHub). This also allows me to add notes about **why** I might have wanted to save some of these links.

## Collections

* [Getting started with machine learning](https://github.com/collections/machine-learning)

## Topics

* [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome)
    * [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi#readme) - a list of sci-fi books I'd like to look through later.

## Organizations

The ability to follow organizations on GitHub has [been lacking for years](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/50). There used to be a hacky, [backdoor way to follow organizations](https://coderwall.com/p/sqksba/follow-organizations-on-github), but the trick no longer works.
